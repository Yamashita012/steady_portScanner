# steady_portScanner

This Python script is a simple network scanner that utilizes the nmap library to scan for open ports on a target host. It allows you to choose between three different scan types and provides information about open ports and services.

## Support for three types of scans:
- Syn-Ack Scan: Scans for open TCP ports using the SYN/ACK method.
- UDP Scan: Scans for open UDP ports.
- Comprehensive Scan: Performs an extensive scan including service/version detection, script scanning, and OS detection.
- Displays the target's status, scanned protocol, and open ports with their associated services.
- Input validation to ensure a valid scan type is selected.
